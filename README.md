## Fantasy Fitness

THOUGHTS:
---
 - workout packs are set weekly by app admin
 - workouts get claimed when a person completes it
 - claim means finished!
 - might be easier to start with a giant list of workouts / exercises that each count for x points
 - can then complete them freely to score open ended points
 - maybe the packs are more like suggestions / challenges that are worth extra points
